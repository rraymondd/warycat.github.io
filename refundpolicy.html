	<h3>Refund Policy</h3>

    <p>
    	You understand that use of the Services may result in payments by you for the services you receive from a Third Party Provider (<em>"Charges"</em>). After you have received services obtained through your use of the Service, WARYCAT will facilitate payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider, as such Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, and will send you a receipt by email. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by WARYCAT. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services. WARYCAT will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service.
    </p>

    <p>
    	All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by WARYCAT using the preferred payment method designated in your Account. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that WARYCAT may, as the Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
    </p>

    <p>
    	WARYCAT reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all aspects of the Services at any time in WARYCAT's sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand of the Services. WARYCAT will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. WARYCAT may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different Charges for the same or similar Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for Services from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.
    </p>

    <p>
    	This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services provided. Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, WARYCAT does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by WARYCAT (on WARYCAT's website, in the Application, or in WARYCAT's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services provided is not intended to suggest that WARYCAT provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider. In the event you feel unwelcome pressure to provide a gratuity, you may factor that experience into the rating or additional feedback you give.
